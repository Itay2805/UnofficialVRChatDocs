# Quick overview

VRChat uses the HTTP procotol to get basic information from the server and send information to the server.

## Authentication

Most of the APIs require you to be authenticated.

There are two ways to authenticate (technically one)

1. Send the Authorization header with Basic authentication
2. After calling the any API with Basic authentication save and reuse the returned `auth` cookie.

Using the auth cookie is recommended, as each call with only the auth header will use up 1 of (a limited amount) of sessions

## Client API Key

Every API requires you to give a special API key. To get it simply call the [Remote Config](/SystemAPI/Config.md) endpoint.

The API key is passed in a query string named `apiKey`

?> Last Known key is `JlE5Jldo5Jibnk5O5hTx6XVqsJu4WJ26`
